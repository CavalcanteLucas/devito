[ ] repr (or not just repr) inconsistencies: (f*g).dx.dx.dx.dy  vs  (f*g).dx.dy
[ ] lack of tests (lazy -> evaluation -> check expected "stencil")
[ ] first_derivative, cross_derivative, etc, should return a Derivative object
    (ie they would become ~one-liner functions); Derivative.evaluate should
    do the bulk of the work and implement what first_derivative/cross_derivative/
    etc are currently doing. Otherwise, all existing code making use of
    first_derivative/cross_derivative etc would *not* use lazy evaluation
